## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

- They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- R-Square of the Training Model is 0.76.
- R-Square of the Test Model is 0.74.
- Diffrence of R-Square Training and Testing is 2% which is low so Model is not Over-Fitted.
- weathersit, season, windspeed, weekday, holiday are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- About 74% of the variance is explained by the Model.
